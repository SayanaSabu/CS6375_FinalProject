# Exploratory Analysis - Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset
This project was about an in-depth analysis I did on a binary classification dataset called the "Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset" (imported from Kaggle). Based on various medical factors, the dataset showed if a patient had diabetes (1) or did not have diabetes (0). I used a few Machine Learning algorithms to perform the analysis such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees.

This repository consists of Jupyter notebooks, project presentation, and project report. All code is written in Python, and the models were imported using scikit-learn.
